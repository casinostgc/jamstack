A culture, a people, and a place that's actually a sovereign nation, Cherokee is located right in the heart of Western North Carolina. It's also base camp for hiking in the Great Smokies, arts and crafts shopping, native elk herd viewing, hours of fishing fun, and home to a history that spans millennia. 

No trip to Cherokee is complete without spending an evening here—or three. Once you’ve watched a show, attended an event, done some shopping, and maybe a bit of fishing or hiking, it’s time to lay your head down in a comfortable spot. 

While in Cherokee, don’t miss your chance to experience one of the finest casinos in the Southeast. Harrah’s features over 21 stories of four-star luxury hotel rooms along with fine dining, the relaxing Mandara Spa, and all of the gaming you can possibly want.
