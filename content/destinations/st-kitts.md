Imagine an island that has set aside more than a quarter of its land as a National Park, with a rainforest that is actually expanding in size rather than shrinking. This is St. Kitts. An island surrounded by new and untouched dive sites, marked by massive beds of coral, teeming with fish of every stripe and color.

Here you will be surrounded by wildlife, from chattering vervet monkeys and scurrying families of mongoose, to roaming cows, goats, and black-bellied sheep.

Here you can drive or hike through the Valley of Giants, zip line over the rainforest or climb up to sit yourself in the cradle of Sofa Rock, once the very cap of a now dormant volcano that you can climb to the very edge of, then be guided down 1000 feet to its steaming crater floor.

Once called the Gibraltar of the West Indies for its domination of 18th century battles, St. Kitts so honors its past with careful restoration that the UN has designated The Brimstone Hill Fortress & National Park a World Heritage Site, and it is a living museum of historical exploration.

Whatever you do, leave no stone unturned. Fill your heart and soul with new experiences on this island of a thousand treasures. And make St. Kitts your next great discovery.
