Days filled with sunshine, velvet soft nights and breathtaking scenery are only some of the ingredients that create the unique feel and taste that reflect Saint-Martin.

Peel back the layers of an enticing island. Explore the panoramas of colorful scenery dominated by flaming bright red, orange and yellow flamboyant trees. Take a walk on the wild side of Saint-Martin and explore its hills on a zip line or by horse back. Pick a sun kissed mango dripping with cool juices or a coconut filled with nourishing water.

Divest yourself of the every day on the beaches and discover the heat of powder white sands that are perfect cradles for a tired body. Enjoy the feel of turquoise waters that are ideal for massaging your cares away. Take a dive into an undersea world of coral and caves filled with the color of tropical fish. Or sail on a catamaran to one of the hidden coves that are perfect for an intimate rendez vous.

Savor the culture of fine dining or the adventure of exquisite local cuisine from a barbeque grill at the Lolos in Marigot and Grand Case - where succulent fried fish, lobster and the blends of local seasoning offer you a new taste adventure every day of the week.

Enjoy the tempo created by an unexpected afternoon shower that breaks the heat and sets the temperature for the evening to come. Because, with the choices of nightlife that includes dinner “en tete-a-tete” or dancing to a quick calypso rhythm, you will find the perfect mood to end your evening.
