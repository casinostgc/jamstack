Biloxi is one of the oldest communities in the country, having first been settled in 1699.

Today, the city is a cultural melting pot, with a year â€™round schedule of celebrations, set against a backdrop of sugar-white sand beaches, great deep-sea or freshwater fishing, an array of championship golf courses, museums and historic sites, tantalizing seafood restaurants, and the excitement of 24-hour non-stop casino resorts.

Of course, Biloxi's strongest assets are the smiling faces and warm hospitality that await you.
