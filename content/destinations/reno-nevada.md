What began as a small community built to serve westward travelers in the mid-1800s has become a bustling city that acts as the gateway to northern Nevada, aptly known as "the Biggest Little City in the World."

Within an short drive, there are 15 ski resorts, 50 golf courses, Lake Tahoe, the state capital Carson City, thousands of biking and hiking trails, several lakes that are perfect for fishing and boating, and the entire length of the Truckee River, which runs right through the center of Reno's downtown. Couple those activities with Reno's hotels and casinos, plus a growing nightlife, and you have the perfect place to put up for a few days and enjoy some recreation.
