Located in the heart of Mystic Country, Mohegan Sun is a short ride from endless recreational possibilities. The countryside is yours to discover when it comes to making the most of your leisure time. 

Mystic was founded in 1654 and quickly rose to prominence as a shipbuilding center during the clipper ship era. Nowadays, Mystic has become known for its quintessential New England charm, as well as its two world-class museums: the Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime museum; and the Mystic Aquarium, featuring fascinating creatures from both sea and land, as well as the exhibits of Dr. Robert Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic.  

The relaxed New England charm that has made Mystic a well-known vacation destination can be felt all through the area â€“ from the quiet farm areas of the Northeast corner of Connecticut, to the coastal towns of Connecticut and neighboring Rhode Island. As a result, it has become known as Mystic Country.
