At the northern reaches of the Mississippi, Tunica is one of the South’s leading entertainment destinations. Just 20 minutes from Memphis, it’s home to nine casino resorts and three championship-level golf courses, as well as Tunica RiverPark, the Tunica Queen Riverboat and the soon-to-open Gateway to the Blues Museum. Tunica is a popular starting point for the Mississippi Blues Trail, a scenic highway that winds through Mississippi and takes you to historic blues markers and landmarks.
