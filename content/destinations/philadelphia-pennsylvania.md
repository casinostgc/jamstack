Philadelphia is one of America's most important historical cities. At Independence Hall on July 4, 1776 the Declaration of Independence was adopted and in September 1787 the Constitution was drafted. A century earlier, William Penn, a prominent Quaker, was the catalyst for the changes which transformed these British colonies into an independent nation.

Today, modern office towers and streets exist side-by-side with narrow cobblestone streets. Independence Historic National Park is a highly concentrated strip of early buildings and sights, including the Liberty Bell, Franklin Court, and Independence Hall. To the south lies Society Hill, the city's original residential area. Many of the eighteenth-century buildings have been handsomely restored. Similarly, Germantown in northwest Philadelphia, is another old residential section, first inhabited by Germans and the Dutch. To the west, along Schuylkill River, lies Fairmount Park, a vast belt of greenland containing numerous Federal-style mansions as well as the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Rodin Museum. Just south of that lies the museum district, including the Franklin Institute of Science Museum and the Academy of Natural Sciences.
