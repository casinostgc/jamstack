Just steps from the powdery white sands of Aruba’s famed Palm Beach, The Ritz-Carlton, Aruba, one of the newest and most pedigreed luxury resorts in Aruba, welcomes guests with a warm “Bon Bini.” The local Papiamento greeting is just the beginning of an authentic island experience. The luxury beach resort is a stunning oasis that reveals a new level of elegance, including 320 beautifully appointed rooms and suites, all with private balconies overlooking the Caribbean Sea, four dining outlets, a luxurious, 13-treatment-room [spa](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/Aruba/Spa/Default.htm), two swimming pools, and a 24-hour casino. An unforgettable stay is not complete without an excursion to downtown Oranjestad, just 10 minutes away from our beach resort, for shopping, dining and night life.
