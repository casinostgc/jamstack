#### **$47 Million Renovation**

Silver Legacy is in the process of undergoing a more than $47 million renovation to its resort rooms and suites, projected to be completed by summer 2021\. This comes after an investment of over $100 million for a master renovation project at THE ROW, which was completed in mid-2019.

The current project will include renovations to the hotel’s fifth through 25th floors, with a total of 1,199 redesigned rooms. The rooms will undergo a full transformation, including new furnishings, updated window treatments and drapery, bathroom renovation, replacement of carpeting and flooring, addition of art and decor pieces, and more.
