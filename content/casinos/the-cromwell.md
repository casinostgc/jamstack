Las Vegas is famous for its mega-resorts, but what if you desired something a bit more intimate, where everything you could want–like a rooftop pool club and celebrity chef restaurant–are just steps away? The Cromwell Las Vegas offers each guest a boutique hotel experience with personalized attention. Each room and suite in the 188-room hotel feels like a vintage, Parisian-inspired apartment—think trunk-style furniture, dark woods and eclectic art.

While you’re here, enjoy an upscale dining experience at celebrity chef Giada de Laurentiis’ Italian restaurant, Giada. This second-level culinary hotspot has one of the best views on the Strip. Grab a refreshing cocktail at Bound, the hotel’s lobby bar. Peruse the menu, which comes in the form of a vintage library book. For a more intimate bar experience, have a drink or two at the stylish Interlude lounge. Try your luck at the slots and table games, located on the other side of the bar.

And no trip to The Cromwell is complete without a visit to Drai’s Beach Club · Nightclub. By day, swim and sunbathe in an energetic atmosphere. By night, the party intensifies with both big-name headliners and up-and-coming DJs. And true night owls can unwind at Drai’s After Hours, a basement-level, mansion-like nightspot that stays opens well after the sun comes up.
